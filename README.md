# MexiKAN
This paper proposes a novel KAN variant that integrates the Mexican Hat wavelet into the activation design. The hat-shaped profile of the Mexican Hat wavelet accurately modeling local discontinuities and impulsive patterns, while its spectral energy concentration in the mid-to-low frequency range effectively suppresses high-frequency noise.
