# MexiKAN: Mexican Hat Wavelet-Enhanced KANs for Fine-Grained Signal Modeling
## abstract
Kolmogorovâ€“Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently gained attention for their strong representational capacity. However, their reliance on smooth B-spline activations fundamentally limits their ability to model discontinuous or abrupt signal variations. To overcome this limitation, we propose MexiKAN, a novel KAN variant that integrates the Mexican Hat wavelet into the activation design. The hat-shaped profile of the Mexican Hat wavelet accurately modeling local discontinuities and impulsive patterns, while its spectral energy concentration in the mid-to-low frequency range effectively suppresses high-frequency noise. This combination yields superior robustness and generalization compared to standard KANs. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that MexiKAN achieves higher accuracy and robustness than state-of-the-art baselines.
